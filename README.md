### About the Project
We all have faced the problem of being unable to access and locate resources when needed. Collecting and sharing notes from multiple platforms and students is a time-consuming task.
The resource sharing web app is designed to facilitate university students in sharing educational resources such as courses, notes, and other relevant materials. It aims to create a collaborative and accessible platform that enhances the learning experience and promotes academic success. The web app will provide a user-friendly interface where students can upload, download, and discuss educational resources.
